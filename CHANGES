version 0.54

  * Fixed lots of other shit...added targa (tga) and pnm support...
  * Fixed a bit of stupid programming that caused some memory in
    autodialogs to never be freed.
  * Windows tend to retain their scale when using plug-ins which
    create new images now. (Such as "duplicate").
  * Used purify and found some stupid memory bugs. These include
    creating several arrays 1 bytes too small and using unitialized memory
    in one instance.
  * Fixed a bug in bezier selections when an anchor point was outside
    of the image.
  * Implemented a dirty bit for images. Modified images will prompt to
    be saved before being closed.
  * Made a slight modification to the way the file overwrite dialog works.

version 0.52

  * Modified and improved configure script once again. It should now
    handle determining extra X libs to load better. (Such as -lSM and -lICE).
  * Changed clone so it is now able to operate between windows. It
    currently only works between windows of the same image type. But this
    will be fixed in the future.
  * We now compile with "-ansi -pedantic" when using gcc. This makes
    sure that the source is ansi compatible and should fix some problems
    people were having with non-gcc compilers.

version 0.51

  * Added gaussian blur effects filter
  * Added transfer modes for brushes (lighten only, darken only, etc.)
  * Improved configure script
  * Added standard Makefiles for people who have trouble using the
    configure script. ("Makefile.std", "app/Makefile.std",
    "plug-ins/Makefile.std", "config.h.std").
  * Changed plug-ins Makefile to reflect new version of zlib (which is
    used by png library). zlib is now referred to as `libz' instead of
    `libgz'. 
  * Modified source to provide sunOS 4.1.x compatibility
  * Added "refresh" features to brush selection dialog.
  * Fixed a bug in the brush dialog when there are no brushes.
  * Fixed a selection transparency problem
  * Changed the way black and white colors are found for use in the
    marching ants. (Searches for either black and white or two
    contrasting colors).
  * Fixed a bug with text tool when in pixel size mode.
  * Changed the color select tool to allow either the creation of a
    new color or the modification of the existing
    foreground/background 
    color.
  * Fixed a small bug in "gamma.c" that caused it to use only the red
    gamma value. (phunt@BayNetworks.com)
  * Fixed an even smaller bug in "invert.c" that caused it to crash
    when run on an indexed color image.
  * Fixed a bug in "pixelize.c" that caused it to pop up a message
    dialog incorrectly.

version 0.5

 * Initial release.

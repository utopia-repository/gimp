What's new in GIMP 1.0.1

* Redid the way batch mode works: it now uses script-fu instead of a thin
  wrapper around the PDB. This may break some stuff that relies on batch
  mode, but batch mode was broken in 1.0 anyway
* NeXTStep support
* Portability fixes (should compile on non-gcc compilers)
* gimptool supports a lot more options
* Added gimpfeatures.h header
* Plug-in bugfixes, updates
* New gimp.m4 for plug-ins to use to check for gimp using autoconf/automake
* Less spurious message dialogs
* PDB interface for setting the g_message handler
* App bugfixes

GIMP 1.0 Released!

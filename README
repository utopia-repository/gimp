The GIMP: the General Image Manipulation Program
------------------------------------------------

The GIMP is designed to provide an intuitive graphical interface to a
variety of image editing operations. Here is a list of the GIMP's 
major features:

 Image viewing
 -------------

   *  Supports 8, 15, 16 and 24 bit color.
   *  Ordered and Floyd-Steinberg dithering for 8 bit displays.
   *  View images as rgb color, grayscale or indexed color.
   *  Simultaneously edit multiple images.
   *  Zoom and pan in real-time.
   *  GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF and XPM support.

 Image editing
 -------------

   *  Selection tools including rectangle, ellipse, free, fuzzy, bezier 
      and intelligent.
   *  Transformation tools including rotate, scale, shear and flip.
   *  Painting tools including bucket, brush, airbrush, clone, convolve,
      blend and text.
   *  Effects filters (such as blur, edge detect).
   *  Channel & color operations (such as add, composite, decompose).
   *  Plug-ins which allow for the easy addition of new file formats and
      new effect filters.
   *  Multiple undo/redo.


Requirements
------------

 *  The operating system must support shared memory. 
 *  X11 R5 or R6. (Actually, it may work on R4, but we have not had a
    chance to test it).
 *  The X-server must support the X shared memory extension. (The
    X-server does not actually need to support shared memory so this is
    only a temporary situation until we integrate the configure
    information with the source code).
 *  Motif 1.2 or above.

The GIMP has been tested (and developed) on the following operating
systems: Linux 1.2.13, Solaris 2.4, HPUX 9.05, SGI IRIX.

Currently, the biggest restriction to running the GIMP is the Motif
requirement. We will release a statically linked binary for several
systems soon (including Linux).

NOTE
----

This software is currently a beta release. This means that we haven't
implemented all of the features we think are required for a full,
unqualified release. There are undoubtedly bugs we haven't found yet
just waiting to surface given the right conditions. If you run across
one of these, please send mail to gimp@xcf.berkeley.edu with
precise details on how it can be reproduced.

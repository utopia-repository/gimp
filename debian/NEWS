gimp (2.4.0~rc2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * The gimp package now includes its own Print plug-in, and should
    automatically remove the old gimp-print package that was provided by
    Gutenprint. If you still want to use the extended Gutenprint Print
    plug-in, please install the gimp-gutenprint package.

gimp (1.0.4-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild so we're up-to-date with most of potato's libraries.

gimp (1.0.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

gimp (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

gimp (1.0.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * The gimp package no longer depends explicitly on xfnt{75,100}. I
    downgraded the relationship to a Recommends: and added big fat
    warnings in the README and in the package description.
    Fixes bugs #14600 and #21055. This has been changed because it's
    possible to run GIMP using a remote font server to serve the 75/100dpi
    fonts. However, it's really no big deal to ask for them to be installed
    locally, so the relationship should be Recommends:.
  * The above Recommends: has been changed to xfonts-{75,100}dpi, although
    it's pretty silly that their names were changed without adding a
    Provides:. *grumble*
  * Bumped the version number in the dependancy of gimp on gimp-data-extras
    to (>= 1:1.0.0).
  * libgimp-dev now conflicts with libglib-dev, so people don't try
    compiling plugins when they only have GTK+ 1.1 installed.

 -- Ben Gertzfield <che@debian.org>  Sun, 25 Oct 1998 10:46:23 -0800

 You ***MUST*** <--- (really!) have the xfnt75 and xfnt100 fonts
 available on the X server, whether via files or via a font server

 Version 1.0 of The GIMP is a total re-write of the old 0.54 code.
 It's fully layers-based, making it easy to use and more powerful.

 However, GIF and TIFF support have been moved to a separate package
 (gimp-nonfree) because of the UNISYS patent.

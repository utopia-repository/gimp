gimp for DEBIAN
----------------------
This is Debian/GNU Linux's prepackaged version of the GIMP (the
General Image Manipulation Program).

The GIMP is designed to provide an intuitive graphical interface to a
variety of image editing operations.  See /usr/doc/gimp/README for a
list of the major features, and other info.

The gimp is brought to you by:

  Spencer Kimball (spencer@xcf.berkeley.edu)
  Peter Mattis (petm@xcf.berkeley.edu)

The Debian package was put together by Rob Browning
<osiris@cs.utexas.edu>, from the original GIMP sources.  See the
following locations for details:

http://www.xcf.berkeley.edu/~gimp
ftp://ftp.xcf.berkeley.edu/pub/gimp
mailto:gimp@xcf.berkeley.edu   

The changes for the Debian package were the addition of the debian.*
files, and fixes to the configure script.  The configure script
included libXm, but not libXmu and libXpm which are also needed.  I
also changed CFLAGS in configure to add -O2.  Finally, debian.rules
diff had to be set up to remove the dangling link ./gimp so that diff
didn't break.

Finally, this package is based on Motif.  In order to build the shared
and static packages I had to modify configure, adding a LIBS flag.

The GIMP is covered by the GNU General Public License.  See
/usr/doc/copyright/GPL for details.

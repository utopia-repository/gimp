Description: GIMP (General Image Manipulation Program), static Motif linkage.
 The GIMP is designed to provide an intuitive graphical interface to a
 variety of image editing operations.
 .
 The GIMP's functionality includes:
 .
      Support for 8, 15, 16, & 24 bit displays
      Ordered and Floyd-Steinberg Dithering for 8 bit
      RGB, Grayscale, & Indexed color modes
      Multiple views of same image to ease complex tasks
      Fast zooming and panning on images
      Full suite of selection tools - (rectangle, ellipse, freehand,
        fuzzy, bezier, intelligent)
      Transform tools - (rotate, scale, shear, flip)
      Crop, color picker, bucket-fill, blend, & text tools
      Paint tools - (paintbrush, airbrush, clone, blur, sharpen, convolve)
      Full set of brush masks and support for arbitrary brushes
      File format support - (jpg, tif, gif, png, xpm)
      Numerous effects filters - (blur, edge detect, pixelize, ...)
      Channel operations - (add, composite, blend, ...)
 .
 A good deal of the GIMP's functionality is invested in external
 modules, called plug-ins.  These independent programs are called from
 the GIMP to run as separate processes and carry out essential tasks
 such as loading and saving images, running effects filters, combining
 multiple images with channel operations, and communicating with other
 programs (such as scanning software, ray tracers, other image
 manipulation packages, etc).  Programmers are invited/urged to add
 new functionality by creating new plug-ins.
 .
 GIMP requires Motif. This package is statically linked against Motif
 for people who don't have Motif installed on their system.

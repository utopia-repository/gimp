# Notify the GIMP of the available file plug-ins.
# The format of the line is as follows:
#  file-plug-in <image types> <plug-in name> <plug-in title> <extensions>
# The `image types' argument specifies what types of images the
#  plug-in can save. It is a 3 digit number where each digit is 0 or
#  1. The digits correspond to `indexed images', `grayscale images'
#  and `rgb images' respectively. For example, the "jpeg" file plug-in
#  can save rgb and grayscale images but not indexed color, so the
#  image types argument is 011.
# The `plug-in name' is the name of the plug-in program.
# The `plug-in title' is the title of the program is it will appear
#  from the GIMP. This will most likely be the name of the plug-in.
# The `extensions' are a comma separated string of extensions. These
#  are used by the GIMP to map file names to images.
#  Note: case does not matter for extensions.

# Notify the GIMP of plug-ins that will exist in the `plug-ins' menu.
# The format of the line is as follows:
#  plug-in <plug-in name> <menu location> <accelerator key> <accelerator text>
# The `plug-in name' is the name of the plug-in program.
# The `menu location' is the item name and location in the plug-in
#  menu. A slash indicates a submenu. Therefore, the menu location
#  "Blur/Blur" specifies an item name of "Blur" in a submenu entitled
#  "Blur". Multiple submenus are possible. If a menu already exists
#  the item is simply placed in that menu. Menu items are placed in 
#  alphabetically sorted order in menus.
# The `accelerator key' is a string which designates a key combination
#  which will invoke the plug-in. The format should be clear by
#  inspection. (It is the same one used by motif to specify
#  accelerators). This string is optional.
# The `accelerator text' is a string which specifies how the key
#  accelerator specified by `accelerator key' should be shown in the
#  menu. This string is optional.
#
# If the `accelerator key' is empty, then the `accelerator text'
#  should also be empty.
# It is convention to only use the `alt' and `shift' key modifiers for
#  plug-ins. The `control' key is used as a modifier for menu items by
#  the main application. The main application will not use the `alt'
#  or `shift' key modifiers.
